An open-source time management software based on the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) with a focus on design.

### What's different?

Pomo's main focus is design. The was extra care on making sure it looks visually appealing and feels good using it. Open-source software shouldn't have to look simple and/or ugly.
